It is built on an older version of a Gothic 2 mod, called Gothic Multiplayer (webpage: http://gothic-multiplayer.com).
I didn't write the mod, I just used it. I only wrote the Lua and SQL files.
This was my thesis at university, but I continued the development for a while.

Unfortunatelly, I had to stop this project, because I found some bugs in the mods, which I can't fix. Sometimes, when someone die (not matter it is player or NPC) the server shutdown. I am sure, that my code is right, because the server doesn't have any error messege and it can only happen, if someone has a bigger ping in the game. On localhost it never happened. That was one of the reason, that the mod creaters have started to rewrite it from the begining.

I have implemented:
	Account management
	Character management (character creater, level up, learn)
	Time (real and game)
	Friendly NPC (Vendor,Trainer,Speech,Quest)
	Enemy NPC (animals with AI)
	Quest
	Party
	RP Chat (normal, private, party)
	World Item
	Anticheat
	
Currently THQ holds licence of the game.
This is just a reference work on github.
